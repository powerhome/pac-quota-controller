# GOARCH does not have a default value, so we explicitly set it based on the host where the command
# was called. For example, if we run 'make docker-build' in a local environment with an Apple Silicon M1
# system, the Docker BUILDPLATFORM argument will be linux/arm64, whereas for Apple x86 it will be linux/amd64.
# By leaving GOARCH empty, we ensure that the container and the binary it ships will have the same platform.

# Use distroless as minimal base image to package the manager binary
